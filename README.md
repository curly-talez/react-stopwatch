# React Stopwatch Application

This is a Stopwatch application that I have created as a part of learning react.

I have included four operations

1. Start operation
2. Stop operation
3. Resume operation
4. Reset operation

Included two react hooks - useState and useRef

You can run this in local using:

```
npm start
```
